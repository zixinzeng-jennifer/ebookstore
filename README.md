# ebookstore
This project is mainly written in PHP and SQL (also HTML and CSS for the interface).
First, we start from E-R graphs(describing the interaction between different entities such as books and authors) and design database schema based on relational database theory.
We make sure that the database can support basic book transaction.
Then, we build a database in WAMP, which contains about 50 books.
Finally, we create prototypes of the ebookstore website.
